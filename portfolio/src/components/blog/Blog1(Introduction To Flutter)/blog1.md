Introdution
If you’ve always been fascinated by how to develop apps and always wanted to learn how to, Flutter is the language you’ve been looking for.
In this blog, let’s run through the basics of Flutter and why we should use Flutter. Without further ado, let's get started:

What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. It is Google’s UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

So basically, Flutter lets you develop mobile, desktop and web apps from a single codebase using the language Dart.

Well, now you must be intrigued as to what is Dart?

Overview of Dart:
Dart is the programming language used by Flutter to build cross-platform mobile apps. It’s compiled using Google’s compiler called dart into an intermediate representation that runs on both iOS and Android devices without modification.

Dart is a client-optimized, free and open-source language used to develop fast apps on any platform.
Dart is mainly optimized for UI, it is fast on all platforms as it can compile to ARM & x64 machine code for mobile, desktop, and backend or compile to JavaScript for the web.
Let's get down to business and look at why you should choose Flutter 🤔

Why Flutter?
Flutter can be used to build apps on both iOS and Android while supporting various aspect ratios, screen sizes and devices.
Flutter uses one codebase for all platforms.
It comes with a ton of pre-built widgets like app-bars(top bar), error notifications and buttons(three-dot button, + button etc) in iOS and Android styles and allows a lot of modification like Colors,Background color etc.
Flutter comes with rich libraries.
Flutter uses simple and flexible user layouts which can be used to make beautiful app layouts.
Flutter implements a feature called 'Hot Reload' which acts similar to the refresh button on web pages which updates the app's layout and view as soon as we make some changes.
Flutter allows us to access the original source code of the widgets and built-in functions we make use of.
Let's move on and get started with setting up of Flutter 😁

Before we get into developing our first app, let us look at a few terminologies :

Terminologies:
Widget: Widgets are the fundamental UI unit in Flutter. They represent an interactive element of a user interface such as a button or text field. Flutter offers a range of widgets that we can use and modify as per our needs. You can find them on the documentation page on the widget catalog page.
